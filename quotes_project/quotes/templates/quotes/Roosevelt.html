                Anna Eleanor Roosevelt was an American political leader who used her influence as an active First Lady
                from 1933 to 1945 to promote the New Deal policies of her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as
                well as taking a prominent role as an advocate for civil rights. After her husband's death in 1945, she
                continued to be an internationally prominent author and speaker for the New Deal coalition. She was a
                suffragist who worked to enhance the status of working women, although she opposed the Equal Rights
                Amendment because she believed it would adversely affect women. In the 1940s, she was one of the
                co-founders of Freedom House and supported the formation of the United Nations. Eleanor Roosevelt
                founded the UN Association of the United States in 1943 to advance support for the formation of the UN.
                She was a delegate to the UN General Assembly from 1945 and 1952, a job for which she was appointed by
                President Harry S. Truman and confirmed by the United States Congress. During her time at the United
                Nations chaired the committee that drafted and approved the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
                President Truman called her the "First Lady of the World" in tribute to her human rights
                achievements.She was one of the most admired persons of the 20th century, according to Gallup's List of
                Widely Admired People.
